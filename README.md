10/12  upload HW03 Oscillation 1, 2

        Oscillation 1: HW03_1.mlx, pendulum1.m
        Oscillation 2: HW03_2.mlx, pendulum2.m
        
10/15  HW03 Oscillation 3, 4

        Oscillation 3: HW03_3.mlx, damped_oscillator.m
        Oscillation 4: HW03_4.mlx, forced_oscillator.m

10/18  HW03 Oscillation 4, 5 (Please look at HW03_4and5.mlx for updated question 4.)

        Oscillation 4&5: HW03_4and5.mlx, forced_oscillator.m        
        
10/20  HW03 Heatflow
       
       Heatflow 1: HW03_6_heatflow_exercise.ipynb
       Heatflow 2: HW03_7_TwoBarsInContact.ipynb

       All shown figures in notebook are at their initial condition - 
       I commented all the 'display_animation' command to avoid too large file.
       
 10/23  HW04 uploaded, metropolis notebook needs some modification on equilibration time.
        
        Problem 1: HW04_RandomNumbers.mlx
        Problem 2: HW04_Metropolis.ipynb
        
 10/31  HW03 modifed, notation of gamma is modified, graphs are all re-generated.
        
        HW03_3.mlx, damped_oscillator.m
        HW03_4&5.mlx, forced_oscillator.m
        
        HW04_Metropolis.ipynb, modified the definition of equi time, but still have problems with find exact time...
        
11/03   HW05 uploaded, 5.3 (importance sampling) needs modification 

        5.1:     HW05_MC_Randomness.ipynb
        5.2&5.3: HW05_UsingMonteCarlo.ipynb

12/03   HW05 modified importance sampling
        
        HW05_UsingMonteCarlo_modified.ipynb
